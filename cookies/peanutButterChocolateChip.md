## Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies

#### Ingredients

Use some multiple of:

* 1 cup extra chunky peanut butter, or creamy mixed with chopped peanuts
* 1 cup sugar (I use white and will update after experimenting with brown)
* 1 egg
* 1 cup chocolate chips (or as many as the dough will hold)

I like to mix mini semi-sweet, regular semi-sweet, milk chocolate, and dark
chocolate chips depending on what I have on hand.

#### Directions

Preheat oven to 350Â°F.

Measure the peanut butter into a pyrex or otherwise microwave-safe measuring
cup, then zap it in 30-second intervals until it's melted enough to pour into
a bowl. Stir in the sugar, then let it cool enough to be comfortable to touch
so you don't accidentally cook the egg. Add the egg and mix the dough
thoroughly. Let it cool down until it seems unlikely to melt the chocolate,
then add the chocolate chips.

Place dough in balls on waxed paper on a cookie sheet, then flatten them
somewhat. Bake for 6-10 minutes -- if you didn't flatten the dough balls, they
might remain squishy inside while the bottoms burn. Remove from oven and cool
before eating. They tend to be toward the crumbly side, but pretty tasty.
