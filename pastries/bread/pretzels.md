  5. Preheat oven to 450 F, prepare baking sheets with parchment paper and oil.
  6. Bring 10 cups water to rolling boil and add baking soda.
  7. Turn dough out on oiled surface and roll into desired pretzel shapes. [1]
  8. Place pretzels in boiling water for 30 seconds each, then place on baking sheet.
  9. Brush each pretzel with egg yolk and salt/season to taste.
  10. Bake until dark golden brown in color, about 12-14 mins

#### Notes
1. Suggested Pretzel Shapes:
  - Standard Knot: roll into 24-inch rope, make a U-shape holding the ends and press ends firmly into bottom of the U
  - Pig-in-a-pretzel: With Beer Bratwursts, pinch dough in center to make a donut shape, insert bratwurst and roll/wrap dough around brat until dough is covering bratwurst about 1/4-inch all around
  - Rolls, Loafs, Lumps, Sticks: self-explanatory, get creative
