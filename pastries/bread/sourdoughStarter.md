## Sourdough Starter

#### Ingredients:

* 2 cups warm water

* 1 tbsp (1 packet) active dry yeast

* 1 tsp sugar

* 2 cups all-purpose flour

#### Directions:

  1. In large bowl or jar, combine water, yeast, and sugar. Let sit until yeast is foamy (5 mins)
  2. Add flour and stir vigorously to work air into mixture.
  3. Cover with a towel and let sit in a warm, draft-free place for 12 - 48 hours.

##### Notes:
  * Do not store starter in air-tight container. Container may explode due to pressure.
  * Starter may be preserved indefinitely with proper care:
    - Refrigerate in plastic wrapped container when not in use.
    - After using part of starter, replace used amount of starter with equal amounts of flour and water, and stir into mixture. (i.e. If used 1 cup starter: add 1 cup water and 1 cup flour)
    - Starter must be fed every few days. Remove a cup of starter and replace with equal amounts water and flour.
    - If not able to feed for a week or more, store starter in freezer in sealed container, thaw at least 2 days before use.
