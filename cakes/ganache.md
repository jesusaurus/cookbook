# Ingredients #

* 1 regular (10oz?) bag of Ghiardelli 60% cocoa chocolate chips
* 1 pint heavy whipping cream

# Directions #

Boil the cream in a saucepan or something. Stir it occasionally, but it won't
burn and it won't scorch and it won't catch on fire, even though you expect it
to, I promise. Resist the temptation to put the chocolate into the cream now.

Dump the chocolate chips into a bowl and then pour the boiling cream over
them. Whisk it all up and the chocolate will melt almost instantly.

Refrigerate overnight, or until the mixture is firm. Attempt to whip it once
it's cold, though don't be surprised if it's stronger than your mixer. One
batch was enough to generously cover 3 8"-square cakes.
