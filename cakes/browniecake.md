## Brownie Cake

#### Ingredients

* 2 cups white sugar
* 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 eggs
* 1 cup milk
* 1/2 cup vegetable oil
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 cup boiling water

#### Directions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two nine
inch round pans.

In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder,
baking soda and salt. Add the eggs, milk, oil and vanilla, mix for 2 minutes
on medium speed of mixer. Stir in the boiling water last. Batter will be thin.
Pour evenly into the prepared pans.

Bake 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cake tests done
with a toothpick. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack
to cool completely.

For Nibz's 25th birthday, I topped it with chocolate ganache rather than
regular icing.
