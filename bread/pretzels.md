[1] Suggested Pretzel Shapes:
  Standard Knot: roll into 24-inch rope, make a U-shape holding the ends and press ends firmly into bottom of the U
  Pig-in-a-pretzel: With Beer Bratwursts, pinch dough in center to make a donut shape, insert bratwurst and roll/wrap dough around brat until dough is covering bratwurst about 1/4-inch all around
  Rolls, Loafs, Lumps, Sticks: self-explanatory, get creative
